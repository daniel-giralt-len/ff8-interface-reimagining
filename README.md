# FF8 menus in 2019

## Just show me the thingy!

## What's this about?

I've recently bought the Final Fantasy 8 remaster. I love it; aside from aesthetics, the game is the same. 

The biggest innovation FF8 brought was using trainable pets (GFs) to allow you to directly boost your stats (Atk, Hit%, HP...). You do this by junctioning magic you draw from enemies to the stats. It's a lot of number moving, trial and error. I still think it's a fun deviation.

That being sad, the menuing gets to me. It doesn't allow you to switch junction profiles or compare the best magics for each stat. They are way too many submenus to navigate through. Things like that.

So I thought to take a stab at making an interface that's clearer and makes experimenting with junctions more fun!

## The rules?

* Screen must be original PS1 resolution (320x240px). Zooming is ok.
* Try to emulate the PS1's limited power! This means:
  * No new costly functionality. I could remove the item sort button by re-sorting the items every time I looted a new one, but I imagine that would be too costly for a PS1.
  * No graphic abuse either: that means having 256 images on a menu.
* Design it for a PS1 controller. The original FF8 had directional arrows and confirm/cancel buttons for the menu (but it also had many more!)
* The base is the original menus. The new ones have slight changes such as an "exit" sub menu.

## What's done so far?

I'm still messing with emulating the menuing (cursors, navigation, positioning...).

After I've recreated the old interface, I plan to split old and new so you can compare the changes I propose.
